# The HTML section

One of my big projects is this HTMLtest directory, where I fiddle around with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Some of these languages and things that I use in this folder may also be demonstrated here on GitHub as Markdown files. Go to [index.html](index.html) to start! Also, the JavaScript functions I made are in [scripts.js](scripts.js), and the CSS is in [styles.css](styles.css).

*The following is from [instructions.md](instructions.md):*

Click the buttons, read the stuff and right-click the math equations to see the raw code!  
**In other words, have fun!**  

# Fonts:

Header font is [*Open Sans*](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans). Body font is [*Source Serif*](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Serif+4). All licensed under [OFL 1.1](https://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php)

*The preceding was brought to you by Markdown.*

Rewritten in HTML by myself, rendered in the Trinket instruction panel with raw Markdown.
