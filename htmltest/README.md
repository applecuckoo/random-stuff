# The HTML section

One of my big projects is my website, where I fiddle around with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Some of these languages and things that I use on the site may also be demonstrated here on GitHub as Markdown files. Go to [my website](https://applecuckoo.github.io) to start! The raw code for this site is hosted on GitHub Pages in [this repo](https://github.com/applecuckoo/applecuckoo.github.io).

*The following is from [instructions.md](instructions.md):*

Click the buttons, read the stuff and right-click the math equations to see the raw code!  
**In other words, have fun!**  

# Fonts:

Header font is [*Source Serif*](https://adobe-fonts.github.io/source-serif/). Body font is [*Inter*](https://rsms.me/inter/). All licensed under [OFL 1.1](https://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php)

*The preceding was brought to you by Markdown.*

Rewritten in HTML by myself, rendered in the Trinket instruction panel with raw Markdown.
