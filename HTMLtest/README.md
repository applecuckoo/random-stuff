# The HTML section

One of my big projects is this HTMLtest directory, where I fiddle around with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Some of these languages and things that I use in this folder may also be demonstrated here on GitHub as Markdown files. Go to [index.html](index.html) to start! Also, the JavaScript functions I made are in [scripts.js](scripts.js), and the CSS is in [styles.css](styles.css).
