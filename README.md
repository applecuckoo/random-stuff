# My random project repo

The storage bay for random code!

## What is all this, anyway?

This is my random project repo, with Python, HTML, Small Basic and CircuitPython.

## Is it you?

Most of my commits from commit hash **bb80bc2d84edc73d9d5b945ae15e4d681df5821c** will say *Verified*. When you click *Verified*, it will state one of the following:

> This commit was signed with the committer’s verified signature.

That means that I will have made a commit from my laptop or my desktop through GitHub Desktop or VS Code, as both my computers have a SSH key tied to them.

Otherwise, it will say this:

> This commit was created on GitHub.com and signed with GitHub’s verified signature.

That probably means that I got lazy and did it online.

Either way, it's verified so you know it's me. :smiley:

## SSH keys, current as of 18/09/2022

### Windows Rig:

P.S. there may be some commits signed with a GPG key, I ended up figuring out how to use the SSH key so I don't use that anymore.
